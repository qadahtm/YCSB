Memcached DB Layer Implementation. 

This work is done for the project component for ECE595 course at Purdue University. 

We have extended the YCSB software to include a DB Layer for Memcached servers. This layer uses Spymemcached to 


Building Instructions:

Make sure that you have Git, Maven2 and Java installed.  Also, make sure that you have Internet connection as Maven will download the dependencies. 

To download the project source:

$ git clone https://github.com/qadahtm/YCSB-mc.git

The source will be downloaded into a new directory “YCSB-mc”.

Now,

$ cd YCSB-mc

Run the following command to build YCSB with the Memcached DB Layer only.

$ mvn clean package -pl memcached -am

Modify the workload file as desired. A sample is at ./workloads/workloada_mc

Running a workload:

Load Phase:

bin/ycsb load memcached -P workloads/workloada_mc

Run Phase:

bin/ycsb run memcached -P workloads/workloada_mc
